This is the chess engine for our Machine learning chess bot

The Node class initiates a Node in the tree with a board state, parent (None if it is the root node), a variable for whether the game has ended, a variable for whether it has been fully expanded (initially set to true if the board is an end state and has a result), the times that node has been visited, the score of that node, and its children nodes.

The Tree class is originally created and given a root node and difficulty(difficult is going to be given here as the number of iterations the Monte Carlos Tree Search will go through)

    The chooseMove function is the main function of the tree which initiates the Monte Carlos Tree Search. This goes for a number of iterations equal to the epochs (variable named difficulty and set in Move function). First you choose the best node to expand, then you simulate the expansion of that node, and then you backprop the score returned. After you have done that loop, you return the board state of the move from the root with the highest score. We have an updated root method here that updates the root to the move played so we can quickly simulate a game but it is not necessary.

    The selectExpansion function called from chooseMove checks that the root node is not fullyExpanded. If neither of those things are true it is sent to the expand function. If it is fullyExpanded, we go ahead and pick the move with the highest score from that node.

    The expand function is going to get a list of the legal moves (in random order) then check to see if that child has been made. If it has been made it checksanother move and if it hasn't been made it creates that node.

    Next the simulation function simply makes moves until an outcome is reached and returns the outcome.

    The backprop function updates the score and visits for the nodes that were explored.

    ChooseBestMove calculates the score of each child node using a calculation with the exploration constant (that is 0 when you are checking for the best move at the end). If nodes have the same score it takes a random one.

    The move function is what will normally be called from the chess gui and takes an argument of the board and difficulty. Then it creates the Tree and runs MCTS.
